# Daily Task Mover

Move a task (with all its rich-text sub-items) from the current daily note to the previous or next day's daily note, and re-position it under the same heading it came from in the source note.

## Features

- Move tasks via an inline icon at the end of each top-level task line, or via the command palette
- Customizable left-click / right-click actions: popup menu, move to previous day, move to next day, or no action
- Whole-task move: a task block including sub-items (nested lists, embeds, references, etc.) moves together
- Heading re-positioning: appended at the end of the matching same-level heading in the target note; auto-creates the heading if the target note does not have it
- Conflict detection: shows a Notice and skips the move if the target note already contains the same task line
- Format compatibility: supports any moment.js date format configured in the Daily Notes plugin (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY.MM.DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, nested `YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD`, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- **The built-in "Daily notes" core plugin must be enabled**: this plugin relies on its settings (date format, folder, template) to recognize and locate daily notes. Confirm "Daily notes" is turned on under `Settings → Core plugins`.

## Usage

1. Open any daily note
2. Hover over a top-level task — an arrow icon appears at the end of the line
3. Click (or right-click, depending on your settings) the icon to move the task to the previous or next day, or use the corresponding command in the command palette

## Settings

- **Left click action** / **Right click action**: choose what happens when clicking the inline task icon — `Popup menu`, `Move to previous day`, `Move to next day`, or `No action`
- **Enable previous day** / **Enable next day**: control whether the corresponding options appear in the popup menu. These are editable only when the left or right click action is set to `Popup menu`
